1. **Adopt Defense in Depth**
   - Layered security approach with firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption.


2. **Regular Security Audits**

   - Periodic assessments of systems to identify vulnerabilities.

3. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

   - Strengthens user authentication using two or more verification factors.

4. **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**

   - Incorporate security at every phase of software development.
   

5. **Continuous Monitoring**

   - Use SIEM tools to monitor for potential threats in real-time.

## Incident Response Plan 
   1. **Preparation**: Develop and test response plans for common incidents.
   2. **Detection and Analysis**: Identify and analyzed security events.
   3. **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: Minimize the impact and restore normal operations.
   4. **Post-Incident Review**: Document lessons learned and update protocols.
