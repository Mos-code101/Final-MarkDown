# Zero-Trust Architecture: A Paradigm Shift

**Overview:** Zero-Trust Architecture (ZTA) challenges the traditional "trust but verify" model, urges for continuous verification for all users and devices.

## Core Principles of Zero-Trust

1. **Assume Breach**
   - Always operate as though the system is compromised.
   - Limit damage by enforcing strict access controls.

2. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Users and devices only receive minimum access necessary.

3. **Micro-Segmentation**
   - Divide the network into smaller zones to restrict lateral movement.

## Implementing Zero-Trust

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Real-time monitoring of system logs and events.
- **Encryption:** All data, both at rest and in transit, must be encrypted.
