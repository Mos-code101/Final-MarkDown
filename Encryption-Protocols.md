# Encryption Protocols: The Backbone of Security

**Overview:** Encryption protocols protect sensitive data by converting it into unreadable formats, ensuring confidentiality and security in digital systems.

## Types of Encryption
1. **Symmetric Encryption**
   - Single key for encryption and decryption.
   - Common algorithms: AES, DES, 3DES.

2. **Asymmetric Encryption**
   - Uses a public and private key pair.
   - Common algorithms: RSA, ECC.

3. **Hashing**
   - Converts data into a fixed-length hash.
   - Common algorithms: SHA-256, MD5.

## Common Encryption Protocols

1. **SSL/TSL**
   - Secures communication over the internet.
   - Used in HTTPS to encrypt web traffic.

2. **IPsec**
   - Secures IP communicaton by authentication and encrypting data packets.

3. **PGP/GPG**
   - Used securing emails and files.
