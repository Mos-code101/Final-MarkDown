# Penetration Testing: Strategies and Tools

**Overview:** Penetration testing (or pen testing) simulates real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in systems, applications, and networks. This section covers methods, tools, and best practices for effective pen testing.

## Types of Penetration Testing

1. **Black Box Testing**
   - No prior knowledge of the system.
   - Mimics an external attacker with no insider information.

2. **White Box Testing**
   - Full access to the system's architecture and source code.
   - Focuses on internal threats or configuration issues.

3. **Gray Box Testing**
   - Partial access or knowledge of the system.
   - Represents an attacker with insider access or credential.

## Penetration Testing Methodology

1. **Planning and Methods**
   - Understand the target system using tools like **Nmap** or **Shodan**.
   - Gather information about IP addresses, domains, and open ports.

2. **Scanning**

   - Identify vulnerabilities using tools like **Nessus** or **OpenVAS**.

3. **Exploitation**
   - Use frameworks like ** Metasploit** to simulate real-world attacks.

4. **Reporting**
   - Document findings and recommendations for remediation.
